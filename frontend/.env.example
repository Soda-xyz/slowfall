# Frontend environment example
# Local development: point to your local backend (do NOT use this for production builds)
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Production builds MUST set VITE_API_BASE_URL to an empty string so the built assets
# call relative API paths (e.g. /api/...) and will be served from the same origin (Front Door).
# In CI you should build with VITE_API_BASE_URL="" or leave it unset in production images.
# Vite doc: https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html

# Example (production build) - intentionally empty:
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=""

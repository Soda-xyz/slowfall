# Enforce LF for text files in the repository and keep binaries untouched
# See: https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes (see `text` and `eol` attributes)

# Treat all files that Git detects as text as text and checkout with LF
* text=auto eol=lf

# Explicit binary files (don't attempt to normalize these)
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.jpeg binary
*.gif binary
*.ico binary
*.zip binary
*.jar binary
*.exe binary
*.dll binary

# Windows shell scripts: if you need CRLF for these, keep the eol=crlf entry
# (uncomment if you actually need CRLF for these file types)
# *.bat eol=crlf
# *.ps1 eol=crlf

# Ensure .gitattributes itself is normalized to LF
.gitattributes text eol=lf
